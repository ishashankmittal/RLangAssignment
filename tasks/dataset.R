# Task 1: Load the "mtcars" dataset
# - Load the "mtcars" dataset using the datasets package.
# - Check the structure and summary of the dataset.
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)

# Task 2: Create a bar plot for average miles per gallon (mpg)
# - Calculate the average miles per gallon (mpg) for each car model.
# - Create a bar plot to visualize the average mpg for each car model.
# - Customize the plot with appropriate labels, titles, and colors.
# - Save the plot as an image file.
#   You can choose the image format you prefer (e.g., PNG, JPEG, PDF).
#   Use the "ggsave" or "jpeg," "png," or "pdf" functions to save the plot.
# - Display the plot.
# Hint: You may want to use the ggplot2 package for creating and customizing the plot.

library(ggplot2)

# Task 3: Additional Customization
# - Customize the bar plot further by adding labels, adjusting colors, and improving the appearance.
# - Save the updated plot as a new image file.
# - Display the updated plot.

# Task 4: Export Data
# - Save the modified "mtcars" dataset to a CSV file for further analysis.
# - Use the "write.csv" function to export the dataset.

# Task 5: Summary and Reporting
# - Summarize the findings and observations from the data visualization.
# - Create a brief report explaining the insights gained from the visualization.

# Task 6: Bonus Challenge (5 points)
# - Create a second type of plot (e.g., scatterplot, boxplot, or line chart) to explore another aspect of the "mtcars" dataset.
# - Customize the plot.
# - Save the plot as an image file.
# - Display the plot.
